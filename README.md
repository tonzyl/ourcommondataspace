# European Stakeholder Mapping, Using Respec

These files are a mapping attempt of stakeholders active in the EU w.r.t. the laws that make up the European Data Strategy and the work on the common dataspace(s). 
The [W3C Respec standard](https://github.com/w3c/respec/) (through the [Logius Respec template](https://github.com/Logius-standaarden/ReSpec-template)) is used to generate a website of these files, which is accessible at [https://ourcommondataspace.eu](https://ourcommondataspace.eu)
