# Data Spaces

The EU is creating a single market for data, adding (regulated) free movement of data to the free movement of people, products/services and capital. The single market for data is being made tangible as the European common data space. The common data space is an amalgam of technological infrastructure (federated cloud services), mandatory data governance, standards and interoperability principles, and sectoral common standards and practices. It is intended to make data sharing and usage more modular while usage conditions and agreements stay attached to the data. The common data space is where the various instruments in the Data Governance Act, Data Act, Open Data Directive, and EU High Value Data implementing regulation will get applied and used. The obligations around data will extend into the applications of data, as such applications get data from the data space and share outputs there too. This means that data flows through applications, including digital twins and AI applications are within scope of the data space.

The European common data space will be the aggregate of a range of sectoral data spaces. This makes it possible to build on what already exists, and stay close to common practices as they evolve in various sectors. There is European funding available for preparatory and implementing actions in a range of sectors, specifically where the EU has its own domain policy goals. The sectoral data spaces that the EC has publicly mentioned are listed below.
