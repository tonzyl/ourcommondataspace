# Events
Events are a good way to meet up, to network, and to get things done together. They form a rhythm to help strengthen the ecosystem of those active in the field of the EU data strategy and data spaces.
Below is a publicly available calender that you can subscribe to (and can embed in your own site if you wish).

Do let us know (info@ourcommondataspace.eu) if you would like to add an event to this calendar.
