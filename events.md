# Events
Events are a good way to meet up, to network, and to get things done together. They form a rhythm to help strengthen the ecosystem of those active in the field of the EU data strategy and data spaces.
Below are a few events listed that may serve as a way to get involved. At some future point we will aim to have a publicly available calender that you can subscribe to.
