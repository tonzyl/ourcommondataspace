# The EU laws of the Data Strategy

The EU Data Strategy that leads to the forming of the European common data space consists of several laws:
- Data Governance Act (DGA), in force
- Data Act (DA), under negotiation
- Open Date Directive (ODD), in force
- High Value Data implementing regulation (EUHVD), in force
- AI Regulation (AIR), under negotiation

Other EU legislative efforts are and will be oriented towards the content of the above laws. E.g. the review of the ITS Directive (Intelligent Transport Systems) will take into account the DGA and DA, as well as the Mobility Data Space plans, and the review of the INSPIRE Directive (government geo-information) will take note of the DGA, ODD, EUHVD and the forming of the Green Deal Data Space and those for agriculture, energy, and mobility.
