# Active organisations and people per country

Many EU MS have civic organisations and/or individuals who are actively engaging with the implementation and impact of the EU Data Strategy and its laws, and the forming of the European common dataspace(s). Below is a growing overview of who is active where, and what the apparant focus of those activities is (which laws or dataspaces are of most interest to them).
